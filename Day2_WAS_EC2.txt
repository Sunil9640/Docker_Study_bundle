EC2 => elastic cloud compute -> cpu ,ram,disk

types of instances of EC2

-> general purpose
-> compute optimize
-> memory optimize
->storage
-> accelerated optimize

when ec2 instance is created

update all the packages
-> sudo apt update

update as the root user sudo su -

apt update
------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a docker on EC2 instance

-> sudo apt install docker.io -y 

-> sudo systemctl status docker  -> it will tell that the docker is running or not

->   sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu   -> this is because you have created the docker using sudo so need to be add ubuntu to docker group

-> **********docker build*********

-> docker build -t sunilya96/mmis/my-first-docker-image:latest


docker run -it sunilya96/mmis/my-first-docker-image:latest


to push the docker images to docker hub 

you need to login


docker push sunilya96/mmis/my-first-docker-image:latest



this is for testing

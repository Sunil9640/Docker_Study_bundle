Introduction of container

hypervisor uses the concept called  virtualization . virtualization  is basically the concept of creating VM on top of physical server

VM is a logical separation 


even tho they arw running on same physical server the VM has is own software and Apps will run on them

-> 	so then why we need containerization

-> container can be created in 2 ways 
one is on top of VM and the other is on top of physical servers



maintain physical server is complex where there is a patch and secutrity fixes

-> containers are very light weight in nature because they dont  have full OS

-> stage 1 docker file  execute -> docker image -> execute image -> create container

-> submit all the commands to docker engine it will create all the containers

-> docker Engine is the single failure of the point that means if the docker is down all your containers are down

-> A containe is a bundle of  Application , application libries, required to run your application  and the minimum system dependencies

-> containers have a base os or minimum operating system dependencies to form a locigal separation from containers


-> files and folders in container base image 

/bin  -> binary executables such as ls cp
/sbin  -> system binary files ,such as init 
/etc  -> configuration files for various  system services
/lib  -> contains libary files that are used by the binary executables
/usr -> contains user related files and utilities such as applications
/var -> contains varailbe data such as log  files,spool files
/root -> it is the root directory of the root user 

this files and folers create a logical sepeartion from other container that means other container wont share this files in common

............................................................................
files and folders that containers use from the host OS

the host file system

Network stack

NameSpaces

control groups

what is docker it is a platform to implement the concept of containerization and docker is the way to containzering your apps,which means
 using docker you can build container images and run the docker images to create containers and also push these container images

->   are there any other technology "PODMAN"
-> docker has centralized docker deaemon
-> docker commands are going to recive by the docker daemon  is the process
-> using docker deamon only we push docker container to docker registory

-> docker deamon is the heart of the docker docker deamons goes down technically docker is down
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is docker file

a set of instructions 

docker daemon itself is like a service



-----------------------------------------------

docker registories stores the docker images  

-> docker HUB is a central registry where you can share your docker images with others
->quay.io is the other central hub like docker hub

-> version control platform for your images
-> registry is a platform where you can share your docker images or store the images
